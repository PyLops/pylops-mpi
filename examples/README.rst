Here is a collection of examples that demonstrate the usage of PyLops-MPI operators and utilities.

.. note::
    All examples are currently run on a single rank when building the documentation.
    However, we test their correctness off-line with multiple ranks and we encourage users to also
    run them with multiple ranks when learning about pylops-mpi.

    Use the following command to run the gallery examples using MPI :

    .. code-block:: shell-session

       $ make run_examples
