Basic Linear Operators using MPI
================================

The subpackage basicoperators extends some of the basic linear algebra
operations provided by numpy providing forward and adjoint functionalities
using MPI.

A list of operators present in pylops_mpi.basicoperators :
    MPIBlockDiag                      Block Diagonal arrangement of PyLops operators
    StackedBlockDiag                  Block Diagonal arrangement of PyLops-MPI operators
    MPIVStack                         Vertical Stacking of PyLops operators
    StackedVStack                     Vertical Stacking of PyLops-MPI operators
    MPIHStack                         Horizontal Stacking of PyLops operators
    MPIFirstDerivative                First Derivative
    MPISecondDerivative               Second Derivative
    MPILaplacian                      Laplacian
