Basic Linear Operators using MPI
================================

The subpackage basicoperators extends some of the basic linear algebra
operations provided by numpy providing forward and adjoint functionalities
using MPI.

A list of operators present in pylops_mpi.basicoperators :
    MPIBlockDiag                      Block Diagonal Operator
    MPIVStack                         Vertical Stacking
