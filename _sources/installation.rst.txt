Installation
############

Dependencies
************
The PyLops-MPI project strives to create a library that is easy to install in
any environment and has limited number of dependencies.
Required dependencies are as follows:

* MPI(Message Passing Interface)
* Python 3.8 or greater
* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html>`_
* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
* `MPI4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
* `PyLops <https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_

Download and Install MPI
========================
Visit the official MPI website to download an appropriate MPI implementation for your system.
Follow the installation instructions provided by the MPI vendor.

* `Open MPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.10/>`_
* `MPICH <https://www.mpich.org/downloads/>`_
* `Intel MPI <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/mpi-library.html#gs.10j8fx>`_

Verify MPI Installation
=======================
After installing MPI, verify its installation by opening a terminal and running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> mpiexec --version

Fork PyLops-MPI
===============
Fork the `PyLops-MPI repository <https://github.com/PyLops/pylops-mpi>`_ and clone it by executing the following in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pylops-mpi.git

We recommend installing dependencies into a separate environment.
For that end, we provide a `Makefile` with useful commands for setting up the environment.

Step-by-step installation for users
***********************************

Conda
=====
For a ``conda`` environment, run

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make install_conda

This will create and activate an environment called ``pylops_mpi``, with all required dependencies.

Pip
===
If you prefer a ``pip`` installation, we provide the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make install

When installing via pip, only required dependencies are installed.
Note that, differently from the  ``conda`` command, the above **will not** create a virtual environment.
Make sure you create and activate your environment previously.

.. _DevInstall:

Step-by-step installation for developers
****************************************

Install dependencies
====================

Conda
-----
For a ``conda`` environment, run

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make dev-install_conda

This will create and activate an environment called ``pylops_mpi``, with all required and optional dependencies.

Pip
---
If you prefer a ``pip`` installation, we provide the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make dev-install

Note that, differently from the  ``conda`` command, the above **will not** create a virtual environment.
Make sure you create and activate your environment previously.

Run tests
=========
To ensure that everything has been setup correctly, run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make tests

Make sure no tests fail, this guarantees that the installation has been successful.

Run examples and tutorials
==========================
Since the sphinx-gallery creates examples/tutorials using only a single process, it is highly recommended to test the
examples/tutorials using n processes.

run examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make run_examples

run tutorials:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make run_tutorials

Make sure all the examples and tutorials python scripts are executed without any errors.

Add remote (optional)
=====================
To keep up-to-date on the latest changes while you are developing, you may optionally add
the PyLops-MPI repository as a *remote*.
Run the following command to add the PyLops-MPI repo as a remote named *upstream*:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> git remote add upstream https://github.com/PyLops/pylops-mpi

From then on, you can pull changes (for example, in the main branch) with:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> git pull upstream main

Final steps
===========
PyLops-MPI does not enforce the use of a linter as a pre-commit hook, but we do highly encourage using one before submitting a Pull Request.
A properly configured linter (``flake8``) can be run with:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make lint

In addition, it is highly encouraged to build the docs prior to submitting a Pull Request.
Apart from ensuring that docstrings are properly formatted, they can aid in catching bugs during development.

Build the docs with:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make doc

or Update the docs with:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> make docupdate
