.. note::
    All tutorials are currently run on a single rank when building the documentation.
    However, we test their correctness off-line with multiple ranks and we encourage users to also
    run them with multiple ranks when learning about pylops-mpi.

    Use the following command to run the tutorials using MPI :

    .. code-block:: shell-session

       $ make run_tutorials
