.. note::
    All tutorials are currently run on a single rank when building the documentation.
    However, we test their correctness off-line with multiple ranks and we encourage users to also
    run them with multiple ranks when learning about pylops-mpi.

    Use the following command to run the tutorials using MPI :

    .. code-block:: shell-session

       $ make run_tutorials

Regardless of the choice of the modelling operator (i.e., ray-based or full wavefield-based), the demigration/migration process can be expressed as a linear operator of such kind:">

Whilst both the entire model and data sit on all processes, within the MDC operator, and more precisely when the :pypylops_mpi.signalprocessing.Fredholm1 is called, different groups of frequencies are processed by the different ranks.">
